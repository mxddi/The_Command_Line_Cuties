# **Meet TimeSlice!**
### _Your new AI planning assistant._

TimeSlice is a mobile app that helps busy college students, professionals, and neurodivergent individuals with daily scheduling. Using machine learning and a robust notifications system, TimeSlice helps people make the most out of every day by recognizing patterns in routines and habits over time, improving schedules based on users' unique needs.

An entire day is sliced into "time blocks" of all a users' tasks and events, ranging from meetings and study periods to meal times and commutes. Users can schedule blocks of "free time" as well to indicate when their schedule is open to new acitivity suggestions. Over time, TimeSlice's unique scheduling assistant recognizes when users may not be maximizing their available time, and offers suggestions for activities to meet individual career, academic, and personal goals. It also suggests breaks in between study blocks (basded on the Pomodor study method) when users forget to schedule "break" blocks during productive activities.

Using push notifications, users are reminded when time blocks are about to end or begin. The app checks in with users at the end of a time block to ask if the task has been complete. IF not, users have the option to accpet and AI-based suggestion to extend the time block and continue finishing the task, absed on how long the AI predicts users will need to finish. It then uses smart scheduling to push all consecutive time blocks ahead by that extra time interval, allowing users to forget the stress of constantly rearranging their schedules so they can focus on completing the acitivty at hand.

### A note on current progress
TimeSlice is under development and still in the prototyping stage. Stay tuned for more updates on its progress by clicking "watch" at the top of this repository! :)
We intend to continue developing this app into a full-fledged mobile application with a scalable database. Although time was limited in the Hackathon, we plan to integrate our proposed AI model using an unsupervised learning algorithm, and transfer our temporary SQL Alchemy data to a larger SQL database. The project will be converted from its FlutterFlow prototype to React Native, and made available in both IOS and Android.

[Here's some of our prototypes made in Figma.](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1239638161463978443)
